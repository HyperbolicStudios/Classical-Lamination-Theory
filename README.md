Python implementation of classical lamination theory, for CIVE 423 (Composite Structures) at UVic. Based on theory outlined in _Mechanics Of Composite Materials_ by Jones (1999).

Use for design purposes at your own risk!

`classical lamination-EI.py` is a calculation of the A, B, and D matrices, and includes a calculation of a composite beam's `EI` property.

`Composite_shell.py` and `filament_winder.py` are simpler calculations for symmetric composite shells, relating the internal pressure of a vessel with the strains of the composite.
